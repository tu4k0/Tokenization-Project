# Tokenization-Project
PROJECT: Tokenization assets using OpenZeppelin contracts and Truffle system development. Use-Cases of project: Tokenization physical assets currency/vouchers/entrance cards.

# Topics of Tokenization project
1. Full Solidity Walkthrough
2. Usage of ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contract
3. Local development with Truffle/Ganache
4. Truffle system configuration using mnemonics
5. Deployment to public networks or consortium networks
6. Creating UI/UX interface for simulating Blockchain interracting with React Box and Metamask

# Approaches
1. Truffle project initialization
2. Add ERC-20 smart contract, that contain contract of a tokenization asset (tokens)
3. Add Crowdsale contract, where clients can buy tokens
4. Add KYC contract, that used for whitelisting clients that can buy tokens
5. Using unit testing
6. Adapt React Frontends to buy and display tokens
7. Deplot to Ropsten/Goerli using hosted Nodes (Infura)
